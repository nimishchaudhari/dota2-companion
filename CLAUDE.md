# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Production-ready React application for a Dota 2 companion app with dual authentication modes, real-time OpenDota API integration, animated UI, and comprehensive player statistics dashboard. Features both Steam OpenID and development mode authentication with complete data transformation pipeline.

## Mission Statement

- The community deserves to resonate with claude's supremacist coding skills and be blessed with a esports grade game companion app

## Architecture Overview

**Service-oriented architecture**: Core functionality split into distinct layers:
- `src/App.jsx`: Main application with AuthProvider and routing logic  
- `src/contexts/`: React Context providers for authentication and data management
- `src/services/`: External API integration and caching layer
- `src/utils/`: Data transformation and business logic utilities
- `src/hooks/`: Reusable React hooks for state management

**Authentication system**: Dual-mode authentication supporting both Steam OpenID (production) and direct Account ID input (development). Uses localStorage for session persistence with TTL management.

**Real-time data integration**: Complete OpenDota API integration with intelligent caching, error handling, and data transformation pipeline. No mock data - all statistics are live from OpenDota.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Development server (http://localhost:5173/)
- `npm run build` - Production build (outputs to `dist/`)
- `npm run lint` - ESLint validation
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

**Note**: No test framework is configured - this is a prototype/mockup with no test suite.

## Key Technical Considerations

**Tailwind CSS 4.x setup**: Uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin (not the legacy `tailwindcss` PostCSS plugin). Configuration in `postcss.config.js` must use the new plugin format.

**ESLint configuration**: Custom rules in `eslint.config.js` allow unused variables starting with uppercase letters (`varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'`). The `motion` import requires an eslint-disable comment due to JSX usage patterns.

**Component structure**: Navigation uses conditional rendering for mobile/desktop layouts. Page routing is handled via `currentPage` state with switch statement in `renderPage()`.

**Animation patterns**: 
- Page transitions use consistent `pageTransition` variants
- Cards use `cardAnimation` with hover states
- Lists use `staggerContainer` for sequential animation timing

## Data Flow Patterns

**Login state**: `isLoggedIn` boolean controls LoginPage vs main app rendering. Login is mock - just sets state to true.

**Page routing**: `currentPage` state + `renderPage()` switch statement. Only 'dashboard' shows real content; others show placeholder divs.

**Animation integration**: AnimatePresence wraps page content with `mode="wait"` for exit/enter transitions. Individual components use Framer Motion `variants` props.

**Chart integration**: Recharts components embedded directly in dashboard with inline gradient definitions (`<defs><linearGradient>`).

## Styling Architecture

**Dark theme constants**: No CSS variables - colors hardcoded in Tailwind classes (gray-900, gray-800, cyan-400, etc.).

**Responsive breakpoints**: Desktop navigation hidden on mobile (`md:hidden`), mobile navigation shown below medium breakpoint.

**Animation performance**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth number counting in AnimatedNumber component.

## Build Considerations

**Bundle size**: Large bundle (700kb+) due to Recharts and Framer Motion - normal for this prototype. Build shows chunk size warnings.

**PostCSS integration**: Requires `@tailwindcss/postcss` in `postcss.config.js` - different from Tailwind v3.x setup.

**ES modules**: Uses `"type": "module"` in package.json - all config files use ES import/export syntax.

### v2.4.0 - Complete Real API Data Integration (June 4, 2025)

**Revolutionary Data Pipeline Integration:**
- **Complete Mock Data Elimination**: Removed ALL mockData references from dashboard components and replaced with real OpenDota API data
- **DataContext Implementation**: Created comprehensive DataContext for centralized dashboard data management with loading states and error handling
- **Real-Time API Integration**: Live data fetching from OpenDota API including player profiles, match history, hero statistics, win/loss data, and MMR ratings
- **Intelligent Data Transformation**: Complete data transformation pipeline converting raw API responses to dashboard-ready format with proper type handling
- **Hero Mapping System**: Automatic hero ID to name mapping with icon support from OpenDota heroes endpoint

The dashboard now displays 100% real data from OpenDota API with no mock data remaining. Users see their actual Dota 2 statistics, match history, hero performance, and MMR progression in real-time.

### v3.0.0 - Professional Esports Command Center Transformation (June 4, 2025)

**COMPLETE GUI OVERHAUL - PROFESSIONAL ESPORTS GRADE:**

**Design Revolution:**
- **Professional Color Palette**: Implemented deep space black (#0A0A0A) foundation with electric cyan (#00D9FF) accents, rank-specific colors, and performance state indicators
- **Typography System**: Added futuristic gaming fonts (Rajdhani, Orbitron, Inter, JetBrains Mono) with proper text shadows and glowing effects
- **Glassmorphism Architecture**: Replaced all flat cards with professional glass-effect panels featuring backdrop blur, neon borders, and animated scanning effects
